1. Words like "it's" are being parsed as two words.
2. Designate an area for synonyms to display, when they click anywhere within a
word, use that word to populate synonyms.
3. Could maybe use iframe to just bring in thesaurus.com page of each word.
4. I think everything's linked in twice. Once in head and once at the end of body.  Link only once.
-- UPDATE: Actually just the css is included in head and js in included at end of body which kinda makes sense.
You want page to first appear properly, not have elements show up and then a second later be style properly.
5. Figure out all the different types of words there are & their abbreviation.:
nouns: 'noun'
adjective: 'adj'
adverb: 'adv'
pronoun: 'pron'
preposition: 'prep'
conjuction: 'conjuction'
determiner: ??? Can't find one.
exclamation: ??? Can't find one.

6. **For some reason it's not working on first click.
